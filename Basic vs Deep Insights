Shows overall sales, but it doesn't tell why, how, or what to do about it.

                                      Nuanced Insight

Sales from New Customers Last Quarter =
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    FILTER(
        Customers,
        Customers[FirstPurchaseDate] >= DATEADD(TODAY(), -1, QUARTER)
    )
)

This tells you:

How much of your revenue is driven by new customers

Whether acquisition strategies are working

That’s a nuanced insight — it helps you make smarter decisions, like reallocating marketing budget if new customer sales are low.
