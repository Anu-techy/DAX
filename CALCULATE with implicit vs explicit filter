CALCULATE without explicit filter
====================================
        High Value Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]), Sales[UnitPrice] > 1000)
                                           or
        High Value Sales = CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]),FILTER(Sales, Sales[UnitPrice] > 1000))

Both can work, the first one is internally converted by DAX into a filter context.
You can skip explicit filter if you are applying a basic condition on a column which doesn't require a row context or aggregation.
Some more Examples are:

        Order Count = COUNT(table_orders[Bill_amt])       
 
        Peter's Delivery = CALCULATE([Order Count], delivery_partner[Name]="Peter") 

        Order Value = SUM(table_orders[Bill_amt])

        Actual order value = CALCULATE([Oder Value], total_order[Deliverry_status]<>"Cancelled")

CALCULATE with explicit filter
===============================

When Do You Use FILTER() Inside CALCULATE()?

1. When You need row-by-row evaluation.
2. When You are applying multiple conditions or a measure inside a condition.
3. When you want to filter using aggregation (like SUMX, COUNTROWS, etc.).

======================================================
When you need to find good orders whose order value is above average order value

Good Orders = 
CALCULATE(
          [Order Count],
          FILTER(
        table_orders,
        [Actual Order Value] > AVERAGE(table_orders[Bill_amt]
    )
)

[Order Count], [Actual Order Value] are meassures defined by using CALCULATE without filter.
Here since we are using measures inside a condition, FILTER is used Explicity.
================================================================

When you need to find Total Sales for Customers with More Than 10 Orders

Sales of Loyal Customers = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    FILTER(
        Customer,
        CALCULATE(COUNTROWS(Sales)) > 10
    )
)

Here, you're filtering customers based on their sales count, which requires row context, Hence FILTER is used Explicity.
=================================================================

When you need to find sales where profit margin > 20%

High Margin Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    FILTER(
        Sales,
        DIVIDE(Sales[Amount] - Sales[Cost], Sales[Amount], 0) > 0.2
    )
)

Here, you canâ€™t write this using a simple filter, because it involves row-wise calculation of profit margin.
===================================================================================================================

When you need Sales amount of Top 3 Selling Products

Top 3 Product Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    FILTER(
        Product,
        RANKX(
            ALL(Product),
            CALCULATE(SUM(Sales[Amount]))
        ) <= 3
    )
)

Here, RANKX needs to work over all products, and then FILTER() is used to limit the context to top 3.
===================================================================================================================

When you need Sales from Last 30 Days

Last 30 Days Sales = 
CALCULATE(
    SUM(Sales[Amount]),
    FILTER(
        'Date',
        'Date'[Date] >= TODAY() - 30 && 'Date'[Date] <= TODAY()
    )
)

Here, FILTER() applies a rolling date range dynamically using TODAY().
