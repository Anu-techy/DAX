Calculated Column : A calculated column is a new column added to a table using DAX. It is:

Evaluated row by row (uses row context)

Physically stored in the data model

Useful for creating categorical fields for filtering, grouping, or slicing visuals

Evaluated once during data refresh, but increases model size


Measure : A measure is a calculation defined in DAX that:

Is not stored in the model — evaluated only when used in a visual

Is calculated at query time (on the fly)

Uses filter context — responds dynamically to slicers, filters, and visuals

Is more efficient for aggregations and KPIs
