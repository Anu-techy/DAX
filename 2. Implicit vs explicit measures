Implicit measures are auto-generated simple basic aggregations (like sum, average, count) that are created automatically 
when you drag a field into a value area of a visual. They can't handle complex logic such as :

Time intelligence (e.g., running totals, period-to-date calculations)

Custom conditions (e.g., sales above a certain threshold)

They are useful for quick exploration but fall short when deeper insights or custom business rules are needed.

Explicit Measure: 

DAX allows you to build explicit measures â€” reusable, powerful expressions with custom logic tailored to specific business needs.

Key Advantages of DAX:

Advanced Calculations: You can create measures like:

            Profit Margin = (Revenue - Cost) / Revenue

            YoY Growth = ([This Year] - [Last Year]) / [Last Year]

Time Intelligence: Easily perform time-based analysis using functions like:

            TOTALYTD(), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(), DATESINPERIOD()

Row Context & Filter Context: Apply logic at row level or filter level for nuanced insights.

Reusability: Once defined, DAX measures can be reused across reports, making models cleaner and more efficient.

Customization: Tailor calculations to match specific business rules or KPIs.
