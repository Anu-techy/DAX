Base measures

Total Amount = SUM(shipments[Amunt])
Shipment Count = countrows(shipments)
Total Boxes = SUM(shipments[Boxes])

Composite measures

Which product has more boxes per shipment?

          Boxes per Shipment = [Total Boxes] / [Shipment Count]

This measure helps to find Boxes per Shipment  per product or per salesman

          Amount per Shipment = DIVIDE([Total Amount],[Shipment Count])

If we keep a slicer for regions we can find amount per shipment per region
which helps in deeper analysis

Measures can be reused further for deeper insightss
